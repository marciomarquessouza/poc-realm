## About Realm

Realm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables.
This project hosts the JavaScript versions of [Realm](https://realm.io/). Currently we only support React Native (both iOS & Android) and Node.js (on MacOS and Linux) but we are considering adding support for Cordova/PhoneGap/Ionic as well.

## Conclusion

First, I've tried a database called "WatermelonDB", but I have some issues with typescript and actions. So, I give up and moved to Realm.

I had some bad moments with the old version of Realm, but this one (6.0.4) was very successful. Very fast and easy to create schemas and query my data.
